## International Financial Fraud By Ex-Hush Community Members

"Sunshine Is The Best Medicine" - Some rando

TLDR: myhush(.)org has gone malicous due to the ex-technical writer for
HUSH, Tamsin Valhalla Thorn (clamoring, USA), selling the domain to a
disgruntled ex-developer Gilard Helena (gilardh, Paris, France) via the disgruntled
ex-community manager of HUSH, Alex Bergeron (berg, USA).
The Official domain of HUSH is now https://hush.is , which is clearly
much less typing and way better in every way :)

The domain myhush(.)org was never legally the property of Ms. Thorn, she
took ownership of the domain via a complex handover process from
previous generations of Hush developers and never returned it after she
retired from the project.

Under the guidance of disgruntled Alex Bergeron, she sold the domain to
"gilardh", who is planning to serve malware. He spreads Fear, Uncertainty
and Doubt (FUD) about HUSH, and attempts to lie to people about how the
internals of Hush works, even though he is a web developer with
absolutely no clue about how anything inside of a cryptcoin actually
works.

This "gilardh" developer was kicked out of the HUSH community and is now
preparing to maliciously attack any user he can with malware and lies,
if he is not allowed to play with the toys. We have no intention of
letting this scammer back into our community, and we offer this
screenshot of attempted international extortion by gilardh:

We also have evidence of attempted extortion from Alex Bergeron. We
hope this website can act as evidence for users to read about the
situation, and deter further malfeasance from these hooligans.
If users see fit to contact their local or international authorities,
that is up to them. Bitcoin Protocol Is Law around here.
